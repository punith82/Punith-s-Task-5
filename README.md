# Punith-s-Task-5
# 📚 Study Progress Tracker

This is a simple, static **HTML and CSS template** designed to visually track a student's progress across various subjects using customizable progress bars.

---

## 🚀 Project Files

The project consists of the following two files, which must be in the same folder:

1.  **`index.html`**: The main structure and content.
2.  **`style.css`**: The styling for the page layout and progress bars.

To view the tracker, simply open the **`index.html`** file in any web browser.

## 📝 How to Update Progress

Since this is a static template, you update the progress by manually editing the **`index.html`** file.

1.  Locate the `<div class="progress-card">` for the subject you want to update (e.g., Science).
2.  Change the `width` percentage inside the `style` attribute of the inner `progress-bar` div.
3.  Update the accompanying percentage text in the `<span class="progress-text">` element.
